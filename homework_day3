#Question 1:
#User login application: -Get Username and Password values from the user. -Check the values in an if statement and tell the user if they were successful.

print("**********Login Page**********")
user_name = "Elsa"
password ="el3720"

user_name1 =input("Please enter your username: ")

password1= input("Please enter your password: ")

if (user_name != user_name1 and password == password1):
    print("Incorrect username")
elif (user_name==user_name1 and password != password1):
    print("Incorrect password")
elif (user_name != user_name1 and password!= password1):
    print("Incorrect user name and password")
else:
    print("User login verified, you are now logging in.")
    
Please enter your username: Elsa
Please enter your password: el3720
User login verified, you are now logging in.

#Extra: Try building the same user login application but this time, use a dictionary.

database = {"Username" : "Elsa", "Password" : "el3720" }

user_name2 = input("Please enter your Username: ")

password2 = input("Please enter your Password: ")

if (user_name2 not in database[Username] and password2 in database[Password]):
   print("Incorrect username")
elif (user_name2 in database[Username] and password2 not in database[Password]):
  print("Incorrect password")
elif (user_name2 not in database[Username] and password2 not in database[Password]):
  print("Incorrect username and password")
else:
  print("User login verified, you are now logging in.")
